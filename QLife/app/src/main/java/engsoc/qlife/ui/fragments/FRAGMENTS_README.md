# Fragments

These classes are fragments that have specific page UI, and are controlled by activities.

Every fragment here is attached to MainTabActivity, so they all have an options menu that
allows access to the Settings, About and Review activities.

Since each fragment is attached to an activity that has an action bar, and they all have different
titles for the action bar, all of these fragments implement IQLActionbarFragment. All of these fragments
are also accessed using the drawer (some from fragments that come from the drawer) so they all also
implement IQLDrawerItem.

## BuildingsFragment

This fragment shows a list of Queen's buildings; each card has a building's name, description and if it has food available.

Clicking on a card will send the user to OneBuildingFragment.

This fragment is accessed from the drawer layout.

Since BuildingsFragment shows a ListView that goes to another fragment when a card is clicked, it implements
IQLListFragmentWithChild.

It queries the phone database for the full Buildings table in order to populate the ListView.

## CafeteriasFragment

This fragment shows a list of Queen's cafeterias; the name and its hours.

This fragment is accessed from the drawer layout.

## DayFragment

This fragment shows a list of classes for the set day; showing the name, start/end time and location. It
also allows the day to be moved forwards or backwards using two buttons.

When a class' card is clicked, the user is sent to EventInfoFragment. Clicking the next/prev buttons does not
perform a fragment transaction, it merely changes the current DayFragment day.

This fragment is accessed from the drawer layout.

DayFragment uses a RecyclerView instead of a ListView, so it does implement IQLListFragment, but
it does not actually use one of the methods.
